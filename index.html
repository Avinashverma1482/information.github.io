								<h3>information About "Ferrari Cars"</h3>								
						     	 <div class="message-body">
									
						       		<p >The brand Ferrari is synonymous to luxury, glamour and wealth in the automobile market. Primarily based in Maranello, Italy, Ferrari is an Italian luxury sports car manufacturer that is today renowned all over the world. The company came into existence in 1928 under the able leadership of Enzo Ferrari, who had a dream to manufacture the most elite yet speedy car that would win races. While the car was successful on the tracks, winning most races across the European continent, the company had its troubled financial times between the 1940’s and the 1970’s.

 

										Ferrari primarily launched itself as a car manufacturer to design racing cars. Launched in 1988, the Ferrari F 40 garnered a lot of acclaims and even till date, the car is known to be one of the best sports cars ever. Ferrari was acquired by Fiat in the late 1980’s and this was when the company started to further penetrate into many other countries in Europe and Asia. Ferrari was predominantly operating as a manufacturer of luxury sports cars for racing. The first passenger car wasn’t made until 1947 and this first passenger car was the 125S.
										
										 
										
										Today, Ferrari holds an interest in bicycles, perfumes, watches and electronics along with continuing its hold in the sports car market.</p>

								  <h3>History </h3>								
						     	 <div class="message-body">
									
						       		<p > In 1945, Ferrari introduced a V12 engine which became one of its signatures. It wasn't until 1947, nearly ten years after Enzo left Alfa that the first Ferrari model the 125 S or 125 Sport, rolled out of the factory entrance of the Via Abetone Inferiore in Maranello, Italy. There were only two models originally produced. The car was entered into its first competitive race in May of that year at the Piacenza Circuit, and on the 25th won the Rome Grand Prix.  The car was set to be released earlier, however, the date was pushed back due to the effects of World War II. After the Modena factory was hit by bombs, the company moved to Maranello and built the legendary factory that it still uses today.

										The next few decades, the Italian auto company prospered with its cars competing in and winning major races including the: Mille Miglia (1948), Le Mans 24 Hour Race (1949) and the Formula One World Championship Grand Prix (1951).
										
										In the early 1950s, race car driver Luigi Chinetti opened the first Ferrari showroom and dealership in United States. Until this point, Ferraris were really only available to wealthy racing enthusiasts and for competing in races. The location later moved from Manhattan to Connecticut, but the Ferrari market in the US became and still is one of the most lucrative in the world.
										
										In 1956, tragedy struck when Enzo’s eldest son Dino died of muscular dystrophy. The 1960s were a time of transition for the company. First, in 1961, members of the company including chief engineers Carlo Chiti and Giotto Bizzarrini left and went on to form another auto company called ATS. They had intended for it to be a direct competitor with Ferrari at the time. The departure was said to stem from disputes over Enzo’s wife Laura and her heavy involvement in the running of the company.
										
										Engineer Mauro Forghieri and body designer Sergio Scaglietti were hired to finish the 250 GTO, which, ironically, came to be known as one of the most iconic sports cars of all time.
										
										In the late 1960s, Enzo realized that in order for the company to remain successful and grow in face of competition and market challenges, it needed a partner. In 1969, it found one in the Fiat Group, which bought a 50% stake in the business.
										
										In 1987, the F40 was released. It would be the last model created under Enzo Ferrari. The following year, he died at the age of 90, and the Fiat Group increased its stake in the company to 90%.
										
										After Enzo’s death, Luca di Montezemolo was appointed as the new chairman of Ferrari from 1991 to October of 2014. He was replaced by the current CEO, Sergio Marchionne and plans were announced to separate Ferrari from the Fiat Group. In 2015, the Ferrari N.V. became an IPO and launched on the New York Stock Exchange at a value of nearly $10 billion, and Milan Stock Exchange in 2016.</p>
